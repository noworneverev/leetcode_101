For an array of length O(n)O(n)O(n), the time complexity of binary search is O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn). For example, given a sorted array {3,4,5,6,7}\\{3,4,5,6,7\\}{3,4,5,6,7}, we want to find out if 4 is in this array. During the first bisection, we consider the median 5. Since 5 is greater than 4, if 4 exists in this array, it must be in the left half of the array. Thus, our search interval becomes {3,4,5}\\{3,4,5\\}{3,4,5}. (Note: Depending on the specific case and your problem-solving habits, 5 may or may not be included, but this does not affect the time complexity.) In the second bisection, the new median 4 is exactly the number we are looking for. Therefore, for an array of length 5, we only performed 2 searches. In contrast, a linear search might require up to 5 checks in the worst-case scenario. Binary search can also be mathematically defined. Given a monotonic function f(t)f(t)f(t) in the interval [a,b][a, b][a,b], if f(a)f(a)f(a) and f(b)f(b)f(b) have opposite signs, there must be a solution ccc such that f(c)=0f(c) = 0f(c)=0. In the earlier example, f(t)f(t)f(t) is a discrete function f(t)=t+2f(t) = t + 2f(t)=t+2, and checking if 4 exists is equivalent to solving f(t)−4=0f(t) - 4 = 0f(t)−4=0. Since f(1)−4=3−4=−1<0f(1) - 4 = 3 - 4 = -1 < 0f(1)−4=3−4=−1<0 and f(5)−4=7−4=3>0f(5) - 4 = 7 - 4 = 3 > 0f(5)−4=7−4=3>0, and the function is monotonically increasing in this interval, we can use binary search to solve the problem. If the interval is reduced to a single number and no solution exists in that interval, it means there is no discrete solution, i.e., 4 is not in the array. In implementation, whether the interval is defined as open or closed at the ends does not matter in most cases. Beginners may find it tricky to decide this. Here are two tips: first, try to consistently use one approach, such as left-closed-right-open (commonly used in C++, Python, etc.) or left-closed-right-closed (convenient for boundary handling). Second, while solving problems, think about whether your method will lead to an infinite loop when the interval is reduced to one or two elements. If it does, consider switching to another approach. Binary search can also be viewed as a special case of the two-pointer technique, but we usually differentiate the two. In two-pointer problems, the pointers typically move step by step, whereas in binary search, the pointers move by halving the interval at each step.","s":"3.1 Algorithm Explanation","u":"/leetcode_101/en/binary-search-techniques/3-1-algorithm-explanation","h":"","p":1110},{"i":1113,"t":"This type of problem often uses a hash table or ordered map for auxiliary record-keeping to speed up lookups; paired with arrays or linked lists for continuous data storage to expedite sequential selection or value deletion.","s":"15.3 Composite Data Structures","u":"/leetcode_101/en/advanced-data-structures/15-3-composite-data-structures","h":"","p":1112},{"i":1116,"t":"Design a fixed-size Least Recently Used Cache (LRU).

Therefore, we must familiarize ourselves with the characteristics of each data structure. C++ STL provides several data structures (the actual underlying implementation may vary depending on the compiler): Sequence Containers: Containers that maintain order. vector: A dynamic array, one of the most frequently used data structures, ideal for O(1)O(1)O(1) random access. Since most algorithms have a time complexity greater than O(n)O(n)O(n), we often use vectors to store various data or intermediate results. As insertion and deletion at the tail have O(1)O(1)O(1) complexity, it can also be used as a stack. list: A doubly linked list, which can also be used as a stack or queue. However, since LeetCode problems often use Nodes to represent linked lists, and linked lists do not support fast random access, this data structure is rarely used. An exception is the classic LRU problem, where the characteristics of linked lists are utilized, as discussed later. deque: A double-ended queue, a powerful data structure that supports O(1)O(1)O(1) random access and O(1)O(1)O(1) insertion and deletion at both ends. It can be used as a stack or queue but comes with some overhead. It can also approximate a doubly linked list. array: A fixed-size array, generally not used in competitive programming. forward_list: A singly linked list, which is also generally not used in competitive programming. Container Adaptors: Containers implemented on top of other containers. stack: A Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure, implemented using deque by default. It is commonly used for depth-first search, certain string matching problems, and monotonic stack problems. queue: A First In First Out (FIFO) data structure, implemented using deque by default. It is commonly used for breadth-first search. priority_queue: A priority queue (max-heap by default) data structure, implemented using a vector as a heap. It supports sorting arrays in O(nlog⁡n)O(n \\log n)O(nlogn) time, inserting any value in O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn) time, retrieving the maximum value in O(1)O(1)O(1) time, and deleting the maximum value in O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn) time. priority_queue is used to maintain data structures and retrieve maximum values efficiently, and it allows custom comparison functions. For example, by storing negative values or changing the comparison function, a min-heap can be implemented. Ordered Associative Containers: Ordered associative containers. set: An ordered set where elements are unique, implemented using a red-black tree, a specialized Binary Search Tree (BST). It supports sorting arrays in O(nlog⁡n)O(n \\log n)O(nlogn) time, inserting, deleting, or finding any value in O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn) time, and retrieving the minimum or maximum value in O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn) time. Note that both set and priority_queue can be used to maintain data structures and retrieve maximum or minimum values efficiently, but their time complexities and functionalities differ slightly. For instance, priority_queue does not support arbitrary value deletion by default, whereas set's time complexity for retrieving maximum or minimum values is slightly higher. The choice depends on specific requirements. multiset: A set that allows duplicate elements. map: An ordered map or ordered table, which extends set by associating each key with a value. multimap: A map that allows duplicate keys. Unordered Associative Containers: Containers with unordered associations. unordered_set: A hash set that allows for O(1)O(1)O(1) time complexity for insertion, lookup, and deletion of elements. It is commonly used to quickly check if an element exists in the container. unordered_multiset: A hash set that supports duplicate elements. unordered_map: A hash map or hash table that extends unordered_set by mapping each key to a value. In some cases, if the range of keys is known and small, a vector can be used as a replacement for unordered_map, using the index to represent the key and the value at that index to represent the value. unordered_multimap: A hash map that supports duplicate keys.

As adding or removing elements at the end has O(1)O(1)O(1) complexity, lists can also be used as stacks. tuple: An immutable list, where neither the elements nor the length can be modified. collections.deque: A double-ended queue, a powerful data structure supporting O(1)O(1)O(1) random access as well as O(1)O(1)O(1) insertion and deletion at both ends (making it useful as a stack or queue). It has some overhead but can approximate a doubly linked list. Container Adaptors: Containers built on top of other data structures. heapq: A min-heap (a data structure where the smallest element is accessed first), implemented using lists. It supports array sorting in O(nlog⁡n)O(n \\log n)O(nlogn), value insertion in O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn), access to the smallest value in O(1)O(1)O(1), and deletion of the smallest value in O(log⁡n)O(\\log n)O(logn). heapq is often used for maintaining data structures and quickly accessing the smallest value, but it doesn't support custom comparison functions. Typically, we precompute the custom values and store them as tuples, like (custom_value, index), in the heap. This way, tuple comparisons are done from left to right, comparing the custom value first and then the insertion order. Ordered Associative Containers: collections.OrderedDict: Ordered mapping or ordered table. Note that \"Ordered\" here means maintaining the insertion order, unlike C++'s map, which sorts keys by size. OrderedDict is particularly useful for implementing LRU (Least Recently Used) caching. Unordered Associative Containers: set: Hash set. Allows for fast insertion, lookup, and deletion of elements in O(1) time.

As shown in Figure 1, we can compute the sat matrix using dynamic programming: sat[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j-1] + sat[i-1][j] + sat[i][j-1] - sat[i-1][j-1], which is the value at the current coordinate plus the sum of the rectangle above it plus the sum of the rectangle to its left minus the overlap (i.e., the top-left rectangle). As shown in Figure 2, suppose we need to query the sum of rectangle E. Since E = D − B − C + A, we observe that E can be derived using addition and subtraction of SAT values at four positions. Thus, the preprocessing time complexity is O(mn)O(mn)O(mn), while the query time complexity is only O(1)O(1)O(1).

This is because heaps are complete binary trees, so in an array representation, the parent node of position iii is located at (i−1)/2(i-1)/2(i−1)/2, and its two child nodes are located at 2i+12i+12i+1 and 2i+22i+22i+2, respectively. Here is the implementation of heaps. The two core operations are \"swim\" and \"sink\": if a node is greater than its parent node, we swap them; after swapping, it may still be greater than its new parent node, so we continue comparing and swapping, known as \"swim.\" Similarly, if a node is smaller than its parent, it needs to compare and swap downward continuously, known as \"sink.\" If a node has two child nodes, we always swap with the largest child node. C++ Python class Heap { public: Heap() {} // Swim void swim(int pos) { int next_pos = (pos - 1) / 2; while (pos > 0 && heap_[next_pos] < heap_[pos]) { swap(heap_[next_pos], heap_[pos]); pos = next_pos; next_pos = (pos - 1) / 2; } } // Sink void sink(int pos) { int n = heap_.size(); int next_pos = 2 * pos + 1; while (next_pos < n) { if (next_pos < n - 1 && heap_[next_pos] < heap_[next_pos + 1]) { ++next_pos; } if (heap_[pos] >= heap_[next_pos]) { break; } swap(heap_[next_pos], heap_[pos]); pos = next_pos; next_pos = 2 * pos + 1; } } // Insert any value: place the new number at the last position, then swim. void push(int k) { heap_.push_back(k); swim(heap_.size() - 1); } // Delete the maximum value: move the last number to the front, then sink. void pop() { heap_[0] = heap_.back(); heap_.pop_back(); sink(0); } // Retrieve the maximum value. int top() { return heap_[0]; } private: vector<int> heap_; }; class Heap: def __init__(self): self.heap = [] # Swim def swim(self, pos: int): next_pos = (pos - 1) // 2 while pos > 0 and self.heap[next_pos] < self.heap[pos]: self.heap[next_pos], self.heap[pos] = self.heap[pos], self.heap[next_pos] pos = next_pos next_pos = (pos - 1) // 2 # Sink def sink(self, pos: int): n = len(self.heap) next_pos = 2 * pos + 1 while next_pos < n: if next_pos < n - 1 and self.heap[next_pos] < self.heap[next_pos + 1]: next_pos += 1 if self.heap[pos] >= self.heap[next_pos]: break self.heap[next_pos], self.heap[pos] = self.heap[pos], self.heap[next_pos] pos = next_pos next_pos = 2 * pos + 1 # Insert any value: place the new number at the last position, then swim. def push(self, k: int): self.heap.append(k) self.swim(len(self.heap) - 1) # Delete the maximum value: move the last number to the front, then sink. def pop(self): self.heap[0] = self.heap.pop() self.sink(0) # Retrieve the maximum value. def top(self) -> int: return self.heap[0] By swapping the greater-than and less-than operators in the algorithm, we can also create a priority queue that retrieves the minimum value quickly.","s":"10.6 Priority Queue","u":"/leetcode_101/en/data-structures/10-6-priority-queue","h":"","p":1348},{"i":1352,"t":"Given k sorted linked lists, try to merge them into one sorted linked list.","s":"Problem Description","u":"/leetcode_101/en/data-structures/10-6-priority-queue","h":"#problem-description","p":1348},{"i":1354,"t":"The input is a one-dimensional array, where each position stores the head node of a linked list; the output is a single linked list.

Since the default comparison function of a C++ priority_queue is for a max-heap and maintains an increasing order, to get the smallest node values, we need to implement a min-heap. Thus, the comparison function for the heap should maintain a decreasing order, i.e., the lambda function should use the greater-than operator instead of the less-than operator used for increasing order.

Merge sort, introduced in the sorting chapter, is a classic example of divide and conquer. In merge sort, the \"divide\" step splits the array into two smaller arrays using recursion until we get multiple arrays of length 1. The \"conquer\" step merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array, starting from arrays of length 1 and eventually forming the final array. We can also use a mathematical expression to describe this process. Let T(n)T(n)T(n) represent the time complexity of processing an array of length nnn. The recurrence relation for merge sort is T(n)=2T(n/2)+O(n)T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)T(n)=2T(n/2)+O(n). Here, 2T(n/2)2T(n/2)2T(n/2) represents splitting the array into two halves, and O(n)O(n)O(n) represents the time complexity of merging two arrays of length n/2n/2n/2. Theorem 7.1.

Other divide-and-conquer problems can also use the master theorem to determine their time complexities. Additionally, top-down divide-and-conquer can be combined with memoization to avoid redundant traversal of identical subproblems.

It redefines the problem into subproblems. To avoid repeatedly solving these subproblems, their results are progressively computed and stored, starting from simpler problems until the entire problem is resolved. Therefore, dynamic programming saves the results of recursion and avoids spending time solving the same problems repeatedly. Dynamic programming can only be applied to problems with an optimal substructure. The optimal substructure means that the local optimal solution can determine the global optimal solution (this requirement is not always completely met for some problems, so certain approximations may be introduced). Simply put, the problem can be broken down into subproblems to solve.\" In simple terms, dynamic programming differs from other traversal algorithms (e.g., depth-first search or breadth-first search) in that it stores the solutions of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. The key to solving dynamic programming problems lies in finding the state transition equation, which allows us to solve the final problem by computing and storing the solutions to subproblems. Additionally, we can apply space optimization techniques to dynamic programming to reduce space usage. This technique will be introduced in subsequent problems. In some cases, dynamic programming can be considered a form of memoized traversal. Memoization means that if a subproblem has been solved during traversal, its result can be stored and reused later when the same subproblem is encountered again. Dynamic programming is bottom-up, solving subproblems first and then the parent problem. Memoized traversal is top-down, starting from the parent problem and solving subproblems as they are encountered. If the problem requires only the final state, dynamic programming is more convenient; if the problem requires all possible paths, memoized traversal is more suitable.","s":"6.1 Algorithm Explanation","u":"/leetcode_101/en/dynamic-programming/6-1-algorithm-explanation","h":"","p":1389},{"i":1394,"t":"Try solving this using a top-down divide-and-conquer (recursive) approach with memoization for optimization; then attempt a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.","s":"932.

After processing each position, summing up the results of all positions will yield the required result. In this problem, dp[i] represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index i. For each position i, if a previous position j has a smaller value than nums[i], we can form a subsequence of length dp[j] + 1 ending at i. To check all possibilities, we use a nested loop with i and j, resulting in a time complexity of O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2). C++ Python int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) { int max_len = 0, n = nums.size(); vector<int> dp(n, 1); for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) { if (nums[i] > nums[j]) { dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1); } } max_len = max(max_len, dp[i]); } return max_len; } def lengthOfLIS(nums: List[int]) -> int: n = len(nums) dp = [1] * n for i in range(n): for j in range(i): if nums[i] > nums[j]: dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1) return max(dp) This problem can also be solved using binary search to reduce the time complexity to O(nlog⁡n)O(n \\log n)O(nlogn). We define a dp array where dp[k] stores the last number of the longest increasing subsequence of length k+1. As we iterate through each position i, if the number is larger than all numbers in the dp array, we append it to the end of dp, indicating that the length of the longest increasing subsequence has increased by 1. If the number lies between two numbers a and b in the dp array, we replace b with this number to increase the possibility of forming a longer increasing subsequence. Using this method, the dp array is always maintained in increasing order, allowing us to use binary search to speed up the process. For example, for the array [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,4], the updates in each round are as follows: num dp 10 [10] 9 [9] 2 [2] 5 [2,5] 3 [2,3] 7 [2,3,7] 101 [2,3,7,101] 4 [2,3,4,101] Finally, we determine that the length of the longest increasing subsequence is 4. Note that the final form of the dp array does not necessarily represent a valid subsequence, e.g., [2,3,4,101] is not a subsequence, but the previously updated [2,3,7,101] is one of the optimal solutions. Similarly, for other problems, if the results of the state transition equation are increasing or decreasing and require insertion or search operations, we can also use binary search to speed up the solution.

If each item can only be chosen 0 or 1 time, the problem is called the 0-1 knapsack problem; if there is no limit to the number of items chosen, it is called the unbounded knapsack problem. We can solve the knapsack problem using dynamic programming. Taking the 0-1 knapsack problem as an example, we define a 2D array dp to store the maximum value, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum value achievable with the first i items and a knapsack weight limit of j. When processing the i-th item, if we do not include item i in the knapsack, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j], which means the maximum value equals that of the first i-1 items. If we include item i, with weight weight and value value, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-weight] + value. We take the maximum of these two options during iteration, resulting in a time complexity and space complexity of O(nw)O(nw)O(nw).

As shown in the figure, assume we are currently considering item i=2i = 2i=2, with a weight of weight=2weight = 2weight=2 and a value of value=3value = 3value=3. For a knapsack capacity of jjj, we have dp[2][j]=max(dp[1][j],dp[1][j−2]+3)dp[2][j] = max(dp[1][j], dp[1][j-2] + 3)dp[2][j]=max(dp[1][j],dp[1][j−2]+3). Here, we observe that we always depend only on the information from the previous row i=1i = 1i=1, and the results of other items computed earlier are no longer needed. Therefore, we can remove the first dimension of the dpdpdp matrix, reducing it to dp[j]=max(dp[j],dp[j−weight]+value)dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-weight] + value)dp[j]=max(dp[j],dp[j−weight]+value) when considering item iii. It's important to note that we must traverse in reverse order for each row. This ensures that the value of dp[j−weight]dp[j-weight]dp[j−weight] from the previous row (item i−1i-1i−1) is correctly accessed. If traversed in the forward direction (left to right), dp[j−weight]dp[j-weight]dp[j−weight] would already be updated to the value of item iii before reaching jjj. C++ Python int knapsack(vector<int> weights, vector<int> values, int n, int w) { vector<int> dp(w + 1, 0); for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) { int weight = weights[i - 1], value = values[i - 1]; for (int j = w; j >= weight; --j) { dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - weight] + value); } } return dp[w]; } def knapsack(weights: List[int], values: List[int], n: int, w: int) -> int: dp = [0] * (w + 1) for i in range(1, n + 1): weight, value = weights[i - 1], values[i - 1] for j in range(w, weight - 1, -1): dp[j] = max(dp[j], [j - weight] + value) return dp[w] In the unbounded knapsack problem, an item can be chosen multiple times. As shown in the top part of the figure, assume we are processing item i=2i = 2i=2, with a weight of weight=2weight = 2weight=2 and a value of value=3value = 3value=3. For a knapsack capacity of j=5j = 5j=5, we can fit at most 2 of this item. Thus, our state transition equation becomes dp[2][5]=max(dp[1][5],dp[1][3]+3,dp[1][1]+6)dp[2][5] = max(dp[1][5], dp[1][3] + 3, dp[1][1] + 6)dp[2][5]=max(dp[1][5],dp[1][3]+3,dp[1][1]+6). If we use this approach and assume infinite knapsack capacity with infinitely small item weight, the number of comparisons would approach infinity, far exceeding the time complexity of O(nw)O(nw)O(nw). Figure 6.4: Unbounded Knapsack Problem - State Transition Matrix Example How do we solve this issue? We observe that at dp[2][3]dp[2][3]dp[2][3], we have already accounted for dp[1][3]dp[1][3]dp[1][3] and dp[2][1]dp[2][1]dp[2][1], and at dp[2][1]dp[2][1]dp[2][1], we have already considered dp[1][1]dp[1][1]dp[1][1]. Therefore, as shown in the bottom part of the figure, for cases involving multiple items, we only need to consider dp[2][3]dp[2][3]dp[2][3], i.e., dp[2][5]=max(dp[1][5],dp[2][3]+3)dp[2][5] = max(dp[1][5], dp[2][3] + 3)dp[2][5]=max(dp[1][5],dp[2][3]+3). This gives us the state transition equation for the unbounded knapsack problem: dp[i][j]=max(dp[i−1][j],dp[i][j−w]+v)dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-w] + v)dp[i][j]=max(dp[i−1][j],dp[i][j−w]+v), which differs from the 0-1 knapsack problem only in that the second i−1i-1i−1 in the state transition equation is replaced by iii.

The adjacency matrix requires more memory but allows for faster edge lookup, whereas the adjacency list is more space-efficient but does not support quick edge existence checks. Additionally, we can use an m × 2 matrix to store all the edges directly.","s":"14.1 Data Structure Introduction","u":"/leetcode_101/en/graphs/14-1-data-structure-introduction","h":"","p":1540},{"i":1545,"t":"Follow-up of the robber problem: how to handle circular arrays?","s":"213.

Given that the orchard has an unlimited supply of apples, calculate the maximum number of apples Xiaoming and Xiaowang can eat together. In this example, the greedy strategy is for each person to eat the maximum number of apples they can. This strategy is locally optimal for each person. Since the global result is the simple sum of local results, and the local results are independent of each other, the locally optimal strategy is also globally optimal.

While processing the queue: Add the current node to the sorted order. Decrease the in-degree of all nodes it points to by 111. If a node’s in-degree becomes 000, enqueue it.

Thus, the greedy strategy we use is to prioritize retaining intervals with smaller end points that do not overlap. The specific implementation involves first sorting the intervals in ascending order by their end points (using a lambda function) and then selecting the interval with the smallest end point that does not overlap with the previously chosen interval. In the example, the sorted array is [[1,2], [1,3], [2,4]]. According to our greedy strategy, we initialize with the interval [1,2]; since [1,3] overlaps with [1,2], we skip this interval; since [2,4] does not overlap with [1,2], we keep it.

Similarly, the length of a linked list cannot be determined unless it is fully traversed or tracked using another data structure. LeetCode’s default representation of a linked list is as follows.

Two techniques can help mitigate these problems: Try to operate on the next node rather than the current node itself. Create a dummy node that points to the head of the current linked list. This ensures that even if all nodes in the original list are deleted, the dummy node persists, and you can safely return dummy->next. warning In most algorithm problems, explicit memory deletion is unnecessary.

If the random number is 1, lower_bound returns 0; if the random number is 2, 3, or 4, lower_bound returns 1. We'll delve deeper into prefix sum techniques in the following sections.

In this scenario, we can use reservoir sampling: traverse the linked list, and at the mmm-th node, choose it with a probability of 1m\\frac{1}{m}m1​ to replace the previously chosen node. A simple proof of the randomness of reservoir sampling is as follows: for the mmm-th node in a linked list of length nnn, the sufficient and necessary condition for it to be sampled is that it is chosen, and none of the subsequent nodes are chosen. The probability is calculated as: 1m×mm+1×m+1m+2×⋅⋅⋅×n−1n=1n\\frac{1}{m} × \\frac{m}{m+1} × \\frac{m+1}{m+2} × · · · × \\frac{n−1}{n} = \\frac{1}{n}m1​×m+1m​×m+2m+1​×⋅⋅⋅×nn−1​=n1​ Thus, each node has an equal probability of being selected.

Therefore, traversal requires a Last In, First Out (LIFO) stack, which can also be implemented using recursion, equivalent to using a stack. In a tree structure, since traversal always invokes the new node, it appears as if progressing in the \"depth\" direction. In Python, collections.deque can be used to implement the stack in C++. However, in most cases, using vector in C++ or list in Python is preferred as these structures not only support LIFO but also allow random access. Consider the following simple tree, starting traversal from node 1. If the traversal order is from the left child to the right child, the process follows the strategy of moving \"deeper\" first: 1 (starting node) → 2 (deeper left child) → 4 (deeper left child) → 2 (no children, return to parent) → 1 (all children traversed, return to parent) → 3 (deeper right child) → 1 (no children, return to parent) → end (all children traversed). If implemented with a stack, the stack's top element evolves as follows: 1 → 2 → 4 → 3. 1 / \\ 2 3 / 4 DFS can also be used to detect cycles: Record the parent node of each traversed node. If a node is revisited with a different parent, a cycle is detected. Alternatively, topological sorting can identify cycles: if a node has a non-zero in-degree at the end, a cycle exists. Sometimes, it is necessary to mark already traversed nodes to avoid redundant searches. This technique is called state recording or memoization.","s":"5.2 Depth First Search","u":"/leetcode_101/en/searching-algorithms/5-2-depth-first-search","h":"","p":1770},{"i":1774,"t":"Given a 2D binary grid where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, islands are formed by connected land cells.

However, in real-world engineering, a stack may be preferable to avoid recursion stack overflow and for easier understanding. Below is the stack implementation. A small trick is used for traversal directions: an array [-1, 0, 1, 0, -1] represents the four directions (up, down, left, right).

Be sure to check the boundary conditions when performing recursive searches. This can be done either before calling the auxiliary function or at the beginning of the auxiliary function itself. In this example, we do not use the array [-1, 0, 1, 0, -1] for searching in four directions (up, down, left, and right). Instead, we explicitly write four different recursive functions.

It is commonly used in depth-first search when the state of nodes needs to be recorded. Typically, problems involving permutations, combinations, or selections are more conveniently solved using backtracking. As the name suggests, the core of backtracking is to backtrack. When reaching a certain node, if we find that the current node (and its child nodes) do not meet the target requirements, we backtrack to the previous node and continue the search, while restoring the state modified at the current node. The benefit is that we can modify only the global state of the graph without creating a new graph to store states during each traversal. In terms of implementation, backtracking is similar to regular depth-first search, involving steps like [modifying the current node state]→[recursing into child nodes], but it adds an extra backtracking step, turning it into [modifying the current node state]→[recursing into child nodes]→[restoring the current node state]. For readers unfamiliar with backtracking, this explanation might be unclear, which is entirely normal. The following problems are intended to help you understand backtracking. If it’s still confusing, remember two simple principles: 1. Pass states by reference, and 2. Restore all state changes after recursion. There are generally two cases for backtracking modifications: one involves modifying the last output, such as in permutations and combinations, and the other involves modifying visit markers, such as searching for strings in a matrix.","s":"5.3 Backtracking","u":"/leetcode_101/en/searching-algorithms/5-3-backtracking","h":"","p":1808},{"i":1812,"t":"Given an array of distinct integers, return all possible permutations.","s":"Problem Description","u":"/leetcode_101/en/searching-algorithms/5-3-backtracking","h":"#problem-description","p":1808},{"i":1814,"t":"The input is a one-dimensional integer array, and the output is a two-dimensional array representing all permutations of the input array.

If the sum of the elements pointed to by the two pointers equals the target, then they are the solution. If the sum is less than the target, we move the left pointer one position to the right to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than the target, we move the right pointer one position to the left to decrease the sum. It can be proven that for a sorted array with a solution, the two-pointer approach will always reach the optimal solution. Here’s the proof: Assume the positions of the solution are l and r. If the left pointer is to the left of l and the right pointer has already moved to r, the sum of the two values will be less than the target, so the left pointer will continue moving right until it reaches l. Similarly, if the right pointer is to the right of r and the left pointer has already moved to l, the sum will be greater than the target, so the right pointer will move left until it reaches r.

C++ Python string minWindow(string s, string t) { vector<bool> valid(128, false); vector<int> freq(128, 0); // Count characters in t. for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); ++i) { valid[t[i]] = true; ++freq[t[i]]; } // Move the sliding window and update statistics. int count = 0; int min_l = -1, min_length = -1; for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < s.length(); ++r) { if (!valid[s[r]]) { continue; } // Add the character at position r to frequency stats and check if t's missing characters are filled. if (--freq[s[r]] >= 0) { ++count; } // If the sliding window contains all characters from t, try to move l to find the shortest substring. while (count == t.length()) { if (min_length == -1 || r - l + 1 < min_length) { min_l = l; min_length = r - l + 1; } // Remove the character at position l from stats and check if t's corresponding character is missing again. if (valid[s[l]] && ++freq[s[l]] > 0) { --count; } ++l; } } return min_length == -1 ? \"\" : s.substr(min_l, min_length); } def minWindow(s: str, t: str) -> str: # Count characters in t.

Over the past five years, the author has gained extensive work experience and recognized numerous flaws and shortcomings in the first edition. Thus, at the end of 2024, the author reorganized the content and released this second edition. This book is divided into three main parts: algorithms, mathematics, and data structures, spanning fifteen chapters. It provides a comprehensive explanation of techniques frequently used when solving LeetCode problems. In the first edition, the number of problems was restricted to 101 to align with the term \"101\" (symbolizing an introduction in English). However, the scope of interview questions has expanded over time. Hence, the second edition includes additional key problems to help readers fill any gaps in their knowledge. The author carefully selected problems based on their likelihood of appearing in interviews, ease of understanding, and general applicability. Each chapter concludes with practice problems that readers are strongly encouraged to attempt after completing the chapter. Every regular problem in this book comes with solutions in both C++ and Python3. Since the book’s purpose is not to teach C++ or Python, the author avoids delving too deeply into syntax details and uses some modern C++ standards and Pythonic code. As of late 2024, all code in the book runs correctly on LeetCode and, while maintaining readability, is often the fastest or most space-efficient solution. Remember, solving problems is only a small part of improving your interview and work capabilities. There is a vast ocean of computer science to explore, and it is not recommended to spend excessive time on problem-solving. To become a proficient computer scientist, treat problem-solving as an entry point while also strengthening your professional foundation, improving your skills, and staying informed about the latest advancements in the field. This book was completed during the author’s spare time and may contain errors or areas for improvement. Some problem explanations may lack detail or clarity. Readers are welcome to submit issues on GitHub to help refine the book, and the author will acknowledge your contributions in the acknowledgments section. For suggestions or inquiries, visit the author’s personal website or send a message via email or LinkedIn, and the author will respond promptly. Special thanks to GitHub user CyC2018 for their LeetCode problem explanations, which greatly assisted the author in the early stages of this book. Gratitude also goes to ElegantBook for its elegant LATEX template, which made it easy to transform notes into a professional-looking eBook. The cover photo of the second edition was taken by the author in July 2024 at the seaside town of Sausalito, north of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

This book covers the above categories and most other popular problem types, while categorizing them by type and difficulty level in a step-by-step manner. The first major category is algorithms. This book starts with the simplest greedy algorithms and gradually progresses to two pointers, binary search, sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and finally, more challenging topics such as dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer. The second category is mathematics, encompassing problems related to pure mathematics and computer-related topics like bit manipulation. These problems often test intellectual sharpness but are less commonly used in real-world work. The author recommends prioritizing other categories. The third category is data structures, including C++ STL, Python3 built-in data structures, string manipulation, linked lists, trees, and graphs. Linked lists are a subset of trees and graphs.

However, for a 2D array of size O(mn)O(mn)O(mn), performing four-directional BFS for each position results in a worst-case time complexity of O(m2n2)O(m^2n^2)O(m2n2) (when all entries are 1). One approach is to use a 2D boolean array for memoization, ensuring that BFS does not revisit the same position. A simpler approach, however, is to perform a dynamic search from the top-left to the bottom-right, followed by another dynamic search from the bottom-right to the top-left. These two searches efficiently account for all four directions.
